Context
Needed to make a pothole detection model for my college project, so scraped these images off of the internet and put it here for ease of use.

Content
The dataset contains two folders - normal and potholes. 'Normal' contains images of smooth roads from different angles and 'Potholes' contains images of roads with potholes in them.
